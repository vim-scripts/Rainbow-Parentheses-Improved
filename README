### What is improved ? 

- smoother and faster. (linear time complexity) 
- the code is shorter and easier to be read now. (shorter than 100 lines) 
- no limit of parentheses levels. 
- separately edit guifgs and ctermfgs (the colors used to highlight) 
- now you can design your own parentheses  such as 'begin' and 'end' . (you can also design  what kinds of parentheses to use for different filetypes. ) 
- you can also configure seprately for different type of files. 
- now you can even decide to let some operators (like + - * / , ==) hilighted with the parentheses together.
- now json style configuration used, more understandable and more readable, easily for advanced configuration.
- the last , but not the least , the chinese statement is added as you see.
